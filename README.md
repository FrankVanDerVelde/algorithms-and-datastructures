# Algorithms and Data structures

For this project i worked together with another student. The most notable things we worked on are as follows:

- Implementing multiple different sorts and measuring their speed on different types of data.

- Explored and implemented different methods of the java .stream interface.

- Implemented 3 different types of searsch algorithms (depth first, breadth first, dijkstra).
